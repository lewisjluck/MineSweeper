# MineSweeper
Tentatively begun test into simple, web-hosted arcade game development. 
## Instructions for Use
1. Download python3 from this [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. After successful download, execute the following commands in terminal: "pip3 install flask" and "git --version". Depending on whether your computer already has git, the second command will either prompt you to install it, in which case proceed, or notify you of your current version, in which case move to the next step. 
3. Execute in terminal "git clone https://github.com/lewisjluck/MineSweeper" in an available folder for the game (i.e. Desktop, etc.). 
4. Execute in terminal "flask run" while in the root directory of the game (a folder named 'MineSweeper'). 
5. Enjoy!
